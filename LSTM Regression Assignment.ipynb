    "RNNs and LSTM models are very popular neural network architectures when working with sequential data, since they both carry some \"memory\" of previous inputs when predicting the next output. In this assignment we will continue to work with the Household Electricity Consumption dataset and use an LSTM model to predict the Global Active Power (GAP) from a sequence of previous GAP readings. You will build one model following the directions in this notebook closely, then you will be asked to make changes to that original model and analyze the effects that they had on the model performance. You will also be asked to compare the performance of your LSTM model to the linear regression predictor that you built in last week's assignment.\n",
